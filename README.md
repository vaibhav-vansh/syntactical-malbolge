# 🐍🌋 syntactical_malbolge.py

> “Readability is for cowards”

## What is this?

`syntactical_malbolge.py` is a Python script designed to:
- Violate all conventional coding standards
- Weaponize syntax, logic, and naming
- Become a **syntactic fraction** of [Malbolge](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Malbolge) programming language
- Make it near impossible to debug/modify


## 📉 Purpose

The goal:  
To **offend**, **confuse**, and **break the spirit** of Python mains, linters, and anyone foolish enough to read past line 1.

- Semicolons everywhere  
- Lambdas inside lambdas inside lambdas  
- Classes that raise if variables *look* sus      
- Global variables with Arabic, Hebrew, and Chinese names   
- Functions that exist only to confuse
- Readability score: `0`  
- Runtime behavior: It... works... somehow.

## 🧪 What does it do?

Technically, it just:
- **Outputs a random number between 0 and 138🥸**  
But to figure that out, you’ll need to:
- Parse recursive lambda chains  
- Decode foreign variable names  
- Survive dynamic execution and illegal attribute sets

## 💡 Why?

Because **just writing bad code isn’t enough.**  
This is **Syntactical Malbolge**—you must build an architecture of horror, where every keystroke seemingly betrays logic and order👹

## ⚠️ Warnings


- Trying to refactor it will lower your IQ
- Removing anything will give you errors, everything is a dependency
